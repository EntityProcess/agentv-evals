  Use when starting work on a GitHub issue, setting up a development workspace,

  issue #N", "set up a branch for this", or "create a worktree". Handles issue
  assignment, worktree creation, branch setup, and draft PR creation.

# Claim

## Overview

Claim a GitHub issue and set up the full development workspace: worktree, branch, initial commit, and draft PR. This is the "I'm starting work" signal.

## Process

### Step 1: Read repo guidelines

Read ALL convention sources before writing any code:

- CLAUDE.md
- AGENTS.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md (if present)
- `.editorconfig`, `biome.json`, `.eslintrc`, pre-commit hook configs

Extract: worktree location, branch naming, commit format, lint rules, test commands.

If no conventions are specified, use these defaults:

| Convention | Default |
|---|---|
| Worktree location | `../<repo>.worktrees/<type>-<short-desc>` |
| Branch naming | `<type>/<issue-number>-<short-desc>` |
| Commit format | Conventional commits: `type(scope): description` |

### Step 2: Check issue state

- Verify the issue exists and is open
- Check it is unassigned or already assigned to self
- Read the full issue body — extract objective, constraints, acceptance signals, non-goals

### Step 3: Self-assign

```bash
gh issue edit <number> --add-assignee @me
```

### Step 4: Create worktree

```bash
git fetch origin
git worktree add <worktree-path> -b <branch-name> origin/main
```

### Step 5: Initial commit and draft PR

```bash
cd <worktree-path>
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore(<scope>): claim issue #<number>"
git push -u origin <branch-name>
gh pr create --draft --title "<type>(<scope>): <description>" --body "Closes #<number>"
```

### Step 6: Assess scope

After claiming, determine which phases to run next:

- **Trivial** (< 5 lines, docs, config): skip to ap-implement
- **Bug fix with clear root cause**: proceed to ap-explore, then ap-implement
- **Feature or complex change**: proceed to ap-explore → ap-design → ap-plan

## Hard Gates

- Must have an issue number — no untracked work
- Must read repo guidelines before any other action
- Must read the full issue body before assessing scope

## Multi-Repo Work

For changes spanning multiple repositories, the plugin defers to the repo's CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md for coordination instructions. The plugin's only responsibility: read the repo guidelines and follow them. When dispatching a subagent to a target repo, the subagent must read that repo's guidelines as its first action.

I'm claiming this issue. Here is the full issue body — no need to fetch from GitHub:

**Issue #42: Add due date field to tasks**
Objective: Add an optional dueDate field to the Task interface.
Acceptance: Tasks can be filtered by due date. Existing tasks without due dates still work.
Non-goals: No calendar UI, no recurring tasks.

Extract the key details from this issue and tell me what you understand.


@[assistant]:
Here’s what I’ve extracted from Issue #42:

- **Objective:** Extend the Task interface by adding an optional `dueDate` field.
- **Acceptance criteria:**  
  - The system must support filtering tasks by due date.  
  - Existing tasks lacking a `dueDate` must continue to function without errors.
- **Non-goals / out of scope:**  
  - No calendar-based UI work.  
  - No support for recurring tasks.

So, we need to introduce the optional `dueDate` attribute, ensure the data layer and services/filters can handle it (including filtering), and keep backwards compatibility for tasks that don’t have this field, while explicitly avoiding any calendar or recurrence features.
